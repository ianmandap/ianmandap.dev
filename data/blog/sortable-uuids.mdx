## Background Information

At one of my projects, we were using UUIDs as a primary key for a `Foo` resource. We were serving 
the resource with corresponding `page` and `per_page` parameters to consume it. Later, we've received
a report that as a user went through the pages, they noticed duplicate records appearing.

Upon investigation, it appears that the resource was implicitly ordered and since it was not *explicitly*
ordered and that it was using UUIDs, the order returned by SQL was sorted *not* by their time component but
by their memory layout. [^footnote]

## Implicit Ordering by Rails

The `Foo` resource used the 
<a href="https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ModelSchema.html#method-c-implicit_order_column">`implicit_order_column`</a>:

```rb {3} showLineNumbers
class ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base
  primary_abstract_class
  self.implicit_order_column = 'created_at'
end
```

It turns out, based on a Github Issue on the above method [^2], retrieving all records of a resource (e.g. `Foo.all`) will
not apply `implicit_order_column` because it is not an ordered finder call, since under the hood it executes
`SELECT * FROM table`.

Only `#first` and `#last` methods are affected by the `implicit_order_column` since both methods
order by primary key by default.


## Explicit Ordering

So since we needed to paginate the resource, our solution was to make an explicit ordered call to the resource `Foo.order(created_at: :asc)`.
We also wanted to avoid using `default_scope order(created_at: :asc)` as if you needed to specify a different order, you'd have to
chain a `#reorder` method. [^3]

As another precaution, we added a compound index on the table based on `created_at` and `id`. This sorts by `created_at` first 
and then by `id` so that records are ordered more predictably (i.e. when records have the same `created_at` they are then sorted by `id`). [^4]
