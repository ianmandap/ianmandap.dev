summary: 'Utilizing Materialized Views for dashboards that had complex logic for displaying counts'
---

## Overview

I had a project that needed several dashboards that had a lot of complex logic for displaying counts. Among other things,
the dashboards needed to display a count of various resources in `total`, `previous_week`, and `current_week`. There was also 
the possibility of this requirement changing (e.g. from weekly counts to monthly counts). In its first iteration, a raw SQL query 
was used and resulted in up to 1 minute of response time leading to poor user experience.

A counter cache solution [^footnote] was too simple since it didn't allow for the possibility of a change in time scope and complex 
conditional logic for counts. So I looked into caching the raw SQL queries with Materialized Views.

## Review of Terms

A View is essentially a named query, that instead of typing out the query every time it's needed, you refer to the name of the view 
over that query [^2]. Materialized Views are pretty much the same except it persists the results of the query in a table-like form 
and cannot be directly updated [^3]. This means that access to the resulting data is fast since it's already cached but the data 
is not always current since you would have to refresh the materialized view to re-query and get the latest data.

## Technical Implementation

With the foregoing info, I used the [scenic gem](https://github.com/scenic-views/scenic?tab=readme-ov-file#what-about-materialized-views) 
to create the materialized views for PostgreSQL databases and installation was relatively straightforward.

You generate a Materialized View backed by a Model:
```bash
$ rails generate scenic:model search_results --materialized
      create  app/models/search_result.rb
      create  db/views/search_results_v01.sql
      create  db/migrate/[TIMESTAMP]_create_search_results.rb
```

This also gives us a Model to work with and gives us the following method for refreshes:
```rb
# app/models/foo.rb
class Foo < ApplicationRecord
  def self.refresh
    Scenic.database.refresh_materialized_view(table_name, concurrently: true, cascade: false)
  end
end
```

Edit the `.sql` file and migrate:
```bash
$ rake db:migrate
```

As a side note, since the project needed to compute for weekly totals, I found that there were no PostgreSQL functions 
available to readily compute a `previous_week` or `current_week` time range. As such, these were computed through 
the use of the `date_trunc` function.

SQL snippet of the time range computation:
```sql
-- previous = BETWEEN previous_week_beg AND previous_week_end
-- current  = BETWEEN current_week_beg  AND current_week_end

-- e.g. if timezone('utc', now()) is April 4, 2022 8pm +8 / 12nn +0
-- select
-- date_trunc('week', timezone('utc', now()) - '1 week'::interval) as previous_week_beg,
-- date_trunc('week', timezone('utc', now())) - '1 microsecond'::interval as previous_week_end,
-- date_trunc('week', timezone('utc', now())) as current_week_beg,
-- date_trunc('day', timezone('utc', now()) + '1 day') as current_week_end; -- also equiv to tomorrow's beginning of day

--   previous_week_beg  |     previous_week_end      |  current_week_beg   |  current_week_end
-- ---------------------+----------------------------+---------------------+---------------------
--  2022-03-28 00:00:00 | 2022-04-03 23:59:59.999999 | 2022-04-04 00:00:00 | 2022-04-05 00:00:00

-- Note: timezone('utc', now()) is used instead of now()
-- since now() function returns current date and time based on the database server's time zone setting.
-- Note: BETWEEN is equivalent to a >= x AND a <= y (i.e. endpoints are included).
```

Any future changes to the SQL query would require you to re-generate the view with the same name and repeat the process:
```bash
$ rails generate scenic:view search_results --materialized
      create  db/views/search_results_v02.sql
      create  db/migrate/[TIMESTAMP]_update_search_results_to_version_2.rb
```

I also created a rake task to invoke the refresh.
```rb
# lib/tasks/refreshers.rake
namespace :refreshers do
  desc 'Refresh materialized view for Foo'
  task foo: :environment do
    Foo.refresh
  end
```

And finally, scheduled a cron job that runs every 30 minutes (`*,30 * * * *`) [^4] [^5] to invoke the task.

## Conclusion

Overall, even with the trade-off of not having the latest data, access to the cached result proved far more useful for users with the 
disclaimer that the dashboard data refreshes in 30 minute increments. Implementing materialized views allowed us to cache 
the expensive SQL calls and vastly improve the API's response time.
