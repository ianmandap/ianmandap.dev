## Overview

PostgreSQL allows you to store JSON data (JavaScript Object Notation) with two types `json` and `jsonb`. Both are almost 
identical in that `json` stores an exact copy and requires reparsing while `jsonb` stores a special binary format that's significantly 
faster to process since it does not need reparsing [^footnote]. `jsonb` is usually the preferred data type when dealing with 
dynamic JSON data or when needing to perform JSON operations.

[^footnote]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html

In Rails, we can specify `json` or `jsonb` data types when creating tables for our postgreSQL database: [^2]
```rb
create_table :events do |t|
  t.json "payload"
end

# or
create_table :events do |t|
  t.jsonb "payload"
end
```

## Use Case

In one of my projects, we used the JSON data type since the source data's structure kept changing. We would store the raw response 
in the JSON column and would extract relevant info as necessary. Whenever the data structure changed, we could reparse the original 
raw data as needed.

I'll do an example with some data so this post can be used a quick reference for performing operations:
```bash
rails g model Payload data:jsonb
```

```rb
class CreatePayload < ActiveRecord::Migration[8.0]
  def change
    create_table :payloads do |t|
      t.jsonb :data

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

And some sample data:
```rb
# db/seeds.rb

Payload.create(data: {
  id: 1,
  settings: { version: "1.0" },
  userInfo: { username: 'zzyy998', email: 'zebra@mail.com' }
})

Payload.create(data: {
  id: 2,
  settings: { version: "1.0" },
  userInfo: { username: 'aaa111', email: 'ant@mail.com', placesVisited: [] }
})

Payload.create(data: {
  id: 3,
  settings: { version: "1.1", mode: 'dark', cookies: 'true', details: { foo: 1, bar: 2 } },
  userInfo: { username: 'bbb222', email: 'bee@example.com', placesVisited: [ "USA", "AUS", "CAN" ] }
})
```

## JSON Operations

### Overview
The [PostgreSQL documentation on JSON operations](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html) can be 
hard to understand so I'll do my best to outline code snippets for common use cases.

As a quick guide, PostgreSQL provides the following native operators to query JSON data under Table 9.45: [^3] [^4]
- `->` returns JSON object field as JSON type using a given key
- `->>` returns JSON object field **as text** using a given key
- `#>` for more nested operations, returns the JSON sub-object as JSON using a specified path, where elements are keys or array indexes
- `#>>` for more nested operations, returns the JSON sub-objects **as text** using a specified path, where elements are keys or array indexes

For our purposes, I'll be focusing on `#>>` since the syntax is straightforward and can be used for single or multiple nested data,
and that we would want to return the result as `text` to apply proper `where` conditions.

Also side note, the examples illustrated in the documentation explicitly type casts its input data as `json` using `::json` so 
that json operations can be recognized and would work. In Rails, we don't have to

### Reading JSON Data

Example: Find all records that are `version = "1.0"` <br/>
a. We can use `#>>` for a nested search:
```rb
Payload.where("data #>> '{settings, version}' = ?", "1.0")
#=> returns an array containing ids 1 and 2
```
```sql
-- equivalent SQL query using .to_sql
SELECT "payloads".* FROM "payloads" WHERE (data #>> '{settings, version}' = '1.0')
```

Here, the syntax is straightforward: specify the json column and the path which we want to extract from.

b. For comparison, we can also navigate our way down using the stabby operators:
```rb
# functionally equivalent as above
Payload.where("data -> 'settings' ->> 'version' = ?", "1.0")
```
```sql
-- equivalent SQL query using .to_sql
SELECT "payloads".* FROM "payloads" WHERE (data -> 'settings' ->> 'version' = '1.0')
```

Here, from the json column, we extract the first JSON object (`settings`) and we return it as JSON (the use of `->`) so 
we can continue to operate on it and then we provide a key and return it as text (`->> 'version'`) so our WHERE condition connects.

Example 2: We can also indicate array indexes as part of our search, so to get all records with `USA` as their first `placesVisited`:
```rb
Payload.where("data #>> '{userInfo, placesVisited, 0}' = ?", "USA")
```
```sql
-- equivalent SQL query using .to_sql
SELECT "payloads".* FROM "payloads" WHERE (data #>> '{userInfo, placesVisited, 0}' = 'USA')
```
