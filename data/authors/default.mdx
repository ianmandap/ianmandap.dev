# Hello! I'm Ian ðŸ‘‹
I'm a career shifter turned full-stack web developer working mainly with **Ruby on Rails** and **React/NextJS**. I previously worked as a Licensed Public Tax Accountant but my love for problem solving and using Excel macros eventually led me to pursue the path of programming with Ruby and creating websites.

As someone who learns best with notetaking, I created this blog to serve as a public documentation of anything interesting that I've learned about web development. I've been using [ObsidianMD](https://obsidian.md/), a personal knowledge base and note-taking app working with markdown files, so I feel that the next logical step was to use a blog template that works on markdown files.
